### Hi there 👋 I'm Mariano, here's a little bit about me:

Currently I'm working as a Software Backend Engineer at [**@Vairix**](https://vairix.com)

```ts
const Mariano = {
  code: ['Javascript', 'Typescript', 'Java', 'Go'],
  askMeAbout: ['tech', 'backend development', 'devops', 'the office 💼'],
  technologies: {
    backEnd: {
      ts: ['nestjs', 'express', 'fastify', 'objection', ...soManyOthersFrameworks],
      go: ['fx', 'zap', 'sqlboiler', 'gqlgen', 'mux'],
    },
    devOps: ['Linux', 'AWS', 'Docker', 'Kubernetes', 'Terraform', ...soManyOthersTools],
    databases: ['mongo', 'mariadb', 'sqlite', 'postgres', 'neo4j', 'redis'],
  }
};
```

Here are some random GitHub stats about me, they don't mean anything but they are fun to look at, isn't it? 🐱

**Beware:** As I said, these stats dont mean anything, they are just fun to look at, so don't take them too seriously.

For instance, I don't really code in Lua, I just use it for my Neovim configuration, but it's still might show up in my stats 🤷‍♂️
